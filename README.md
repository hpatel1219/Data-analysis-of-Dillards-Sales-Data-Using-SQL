# Data-analysis-of-Dillards-Sales-Data-Using-SQL
Data analysis of Dillard’s sales trend

Dillard’s, Inc. is an American department store chain with 453 stores across 30 states, consisting of over 1.56 million SKUs / unique items. 

Before beginning the analysis, the most important thing is to understand the data using given database Relational Schema.
Then to get a reliable recommendation from the performed analysis, I cleaned missing data and outliers. 

To analyze factors, affecting sales trends, I created a structured pyramid analysis plan.

SPAP (Structured Pyramid Analysis Plan)

1)	Analyze sales trends, using average daily revenue across stores, departments per month

2)	Analyze sales trends, using information from the geographic locations

        a.	Considering the level of median Income
        
        b.	Considering population group
        
        c.	Considering the level of high school education

This is the part of the Coursera course – ‘Managing Big Data using MySQL’ offered by Duke University.

This analysis is performed in Teradata, which is a Relational Database Management System.
